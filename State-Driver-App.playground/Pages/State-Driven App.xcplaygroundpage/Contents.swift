/*:

Building a state-driven app in RxSwift
==========
 
 **Why State-Driven**
 
 >Apps built upon MVC often end up with a lot of complexity around state management and propagation. We need to use callbacks, delegations, Key-Value-Observation and notifications to pass information around in our apps and to ensure that all the relevant views have the latest state.
 >
 >This approach involves a lot of manual steps and is thus error prone and doesn't scale well in complex code bases.
 >
 >It also leads to code that is difficult to understand at a glance, since dependencies can be hidden deep inside of view controllers. Lastly, you mostly end up with inconsistent code, where each developer uses the state propagation procedure they personally prefer. You can circumvent this issue by style guides and code reviews but you cannot automatically verify the adherence to these guidelines.
